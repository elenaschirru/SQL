# Elena Schirru's SQL Portfolio 
## Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions. I am a Journalist and a Content Creator specialized in Copywriting. Using tools to improve the SEO of the articles I got in touch with the Data World and I am fascinated by them. So I decided to attend a Data Storytelling course and a Data Analytics course, to improve my skills. I am a beginner, just keep it in mind when you look at my SQL code.
